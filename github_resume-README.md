# **Timothy Harris (TMinus36)**

## **ðŸš€ Fastened in Security. Built for Efficiency.**

### **About Me**

From BBS Pioneer to Modern Infrastructure Architect, I'm Timothy Harris, known in the tech community as **TMinus36**. This handle reflects my systematic, "countdown-to-launch" approach to complex technical challenges, where every system is meticulously **fastened in security and built for efficiency.**

My 30-year journey in technology began in the vibrant BBS era, building and optimizing systems when dial-up connections were the cutting edge. That foundational, curiosity-driven, hands-on approach has been my constant companion through every major technological evolution: from assembling my first computers to architecting containerized Security Operations Centers (SOCs) that process over 15,000 security events daily.

### **ðŸ”§ What I Do**

Currently, I operate **Harris Secured Networks (HSN)**, my production-scale SOC. HSN serves as a live demonstration of enterprise-level security orchestration, leveraging technologies like Docker, Ansible, and AI-augmented operations. Every solution I architect and implement adheres to my core principle: **fastened in security, built for efficiency.**

**Key Accomplishments & Expertise:**

* Successfully managed distributed systems serving **10,000+ users**.  
* Implemented **PCI compliance** for financial institutions, ensuring robust data protection.  
* Reduced infrastructure downtime by **40%** through proactive automation and resilient design.  
* Architecting and managing containerized environments (Docker, Kubernetes).  
* Developing and implementing comprehensive cybersecurity strategies.  
* Automating infrastructure and operations (Ansible, scripting).  
* Leading large-scale migration projects with minimal disruption (e.g., 5,000+ customer instances with \<5 minutes downtime).

### **ðŸŽ¯ My Approach**

Security-focused, innovation-driven, with an unwavering commitment to reliability.

Whether it's migrating thousands of customer instances with near-zero downtime or implementing sophisticated zero-trust architectures, I believe in **no-compromise engineering** that prioritizes both high performance and stringent security.

### **ðŸŒŸ Beyond the Code**

I am deeply passionate about **mentoring the next generation of engineers** and sharing knowledge that bridges decades of technological evolution. My experience spans from the intricacies of FreeBSD clusters to the dynamic world of modern containerization. I strive to help teams understand not just *how* to implement solutions, but *why* certain architectural principles and approaches stand the test of time.

### **ðŸŒ± Seeking New Challenges**

I am currently seeking **Senior Infrastructure Engineer** or **Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)** roles where I can apply three decades of systems thinking, operational excellence, and security expertise to solve complex, large-scale challenges.
